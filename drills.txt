Write an algorithm to reverse a linked list. The runtime complexity of your algorithm should be linear O(n). For this exercise, notice, we are not asking you just to print the linked list in reverse or use another linked list to store the value in reverse order. Your program should reverse the direction of a given singly-linked list. In other words, all pointers should point backward. BONUS: Solve this problem using recursive algorithm (and vice versa).
